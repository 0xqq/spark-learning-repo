最近在看一本 'triple your reading speed' 的工具书, 里面介绍的一些提升英文阅读速度的方法很有用, 摘抄记录一下:


<b>READING SPEED - THE EYES DETERMINE IT</b>
What really determines your words-per-minute reading rate ? 

You may be suprised to learn that reading speed is initimately related to eye movements - the fewer, the faster; the greater, the slower. Or, putting it techinically: Reading rate is controlled primarily by the deviations of fixations made per line of print. 

Studies show (and logic supports) that the slower the reader, the more his eyes move as the struggles over the printed page. Very poor ( slow ) readers may make as many or more visual stops per line as there are letters in the words on that line. Good (faster) readers may stop (fixate) only once every two or three word, taking larger visual 'bites' as they move forward. Excellent (fast( readers seldom stop (visually fixate) more than twice per line, and only once on the shorter line-lenghts. 

Then it would follow that the quickest and one of the most effective way to increase reading rate would be to reduce the amount of eye movement.
This will be disscussed at length later. But first, how much do you know and understand abount the function of your eyes during silent reading ?

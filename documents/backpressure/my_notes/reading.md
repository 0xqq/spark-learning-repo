最近在看一本 'triple your reading speed' 的工具书, 里面介绍的一些提升英文阅读速度的方法很有用, 摘抄记录一下:


<b>READING SPEED - THE EYES DETERMINE IT</b>
<p/>

What really determines your words-per-minute reading rate ? 

You may be suprised to learn that reading speed is initimately related to eye movements - the fewer, the faster; the greater, the slower. Or, putting it techinically: Reading rate is controlled primarily by the deviations of fixations made per line of print. 

Studies show (and logic supports) that the slower the reader, the more his eyes move as the struggles over the printed page. Very poor ( slow ) readers may make as many or more visual stops per line as there are letters in the words on that line. Good (faster) readers may stop (fixate) only once every two or three word, taking larger visual 'bites' as they move forward. Excellent (fast( readers seldom stop (visually fixate) more than twice per line, and only once on the shorter line-lenghts. 

Then it would follow that the quickest and one of the most effective way to increase reading rate would be to reduce the amount of eye movement.
This will be disscussed at length later. But first, how much do you know and understand abount the function of your eyes during silent reading ?

<b>EYES ARE LIVING CAMERAS</b>
<p/>
The best way to understand the role of the eyes relative to reading is to compare them to a camera. As you know, in photography the object to be captured on film must be caught perfectly still when the camera's shutter is open or the unfortunate result will be a blur on the film. Therefore, if you want distortion-free images, both the subject and camera must be completely still at the instant the shutter snaps. (Of course, high-speed cameras and improved film and tape now make it possible to photograph objects in motion, but still a blur will maifest if both the equipment and film are not right for the job.) 

The case of principle is the same with reading. The eyes can see well enough to read with accuracy and certainty only when they are absolutely still(fixated). When the eyes are in montion acros the printed line, all letters and words are blurred and no actual reading can take place. In fact, as far as productive rading is concerned, <b>all eye movement is a total waste - a waste of time, energy, and comprehension.</b> When you read, you function much the same as a photographer who, in order to capture on film an expansive panorama (letters, words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, pages, chapters, books), must move his camera(eyes), determine the subject, snap the picture, and then repeat the process again and again.

<b>WHICH READER PHOTOGRAPHER ARE YOU ?</b>
<p/>

Look at the exampls following and study the patterns of the fixations or "eye-stops" of four very different types of readers. Each stop is numbered above the letter, word, or phrase. At this point, where would you place yourself as a reader-photographer? 

<b>The very poor(slow) reader:</b>

W h e n    y o u   r e  a  d   w   o  r  d    b  y

 w  o  r  d    y   o  u    w  a  s  t  e

v a  l  u  a  b  l  e     t  i  m  e

<b>The slow word-by-word reader:</b><p/>
When <p/> you
<p/>
read <p/>word <p/>by <p/>word<p/> you<p/> waste<p/> valuable <p/> time. 


<b>The better-than-average reader:</b><p/>
When you read  <p/>  word by word  <p/>  you waste    valuable time. 


<b>The Accelerated Reader:</b><p/>
When you read word by word <p/>
you wate valuable time.

It is not difficult to see how much longer it would take the very poor reader to cover the same material as the slow word-by-word reader, and so on.

It makes good sense that when you drive, you hope to catch all the triffic lights green. If you do, all other conditions being equal, you will arrive at your destination more refreshed and much sooner than if many or most lights were red. The same principle applies almost exactly to reading. Mak fewer stops and you get through sooner -- and with better understanding of what you have read and less fatigue and frustration.

笔记:文章中的大概意图是为了强调阅读的时候, 应该一个短句一个短句的阅读, 而并不是单个单词的阅读, 类似于计算机处理数据的缓冲区, 每次我们看书的时候,可以将其理解为 IO 处理的过程, IO 频繁会影响 CPU 的处理, 如果我们单个单词阅读的话,需要频繁的让大脑进行 IO 从而降低阅读和理解的速度, 如果将阅读的对象作为一个短句,其实类似于在内存中开辟一块缓冲区, 以批处理的方式向大脑传递书中的信息, 这样不仅会加快 IO 速度, 其实在阅读的时理解力也随之增加(因为单个单词阅读的话,会先把单个单词逐一遍历一遍, 然后在拼接到一起回想一下, 速度慢不说,理解速度也随之降低), 而缓冲区的大小则是可以通过后天训练能够提升的, 只要在平时阅读过程中刻意地训练, 缓冲空间大小会随着阅读者对 短句处理速度和理解能力,是能够提升与拉长的， 唯一和计算机器不同的是, 人脑在经过可以精深练习之后处理信息的能力(cpu 的功率)和处理信息的缓冲空间是可以提升的. （难不成阅读源码的时,也可以使用类似的方法, 毕竟代码的母语是英语,所以编程过程中剖开方法调用等逻辑细节不说,文本表述和代码表述二者之间会存在一定关联）
